# Autoloading Routes

Storing all routes inside a singular file is obviously not ideal for larger applications. This is why the `StringPhp\Router\RegisterRoutes` interface exists. This interface allows you to define a class that will register routes for your application.

## Setup HTTP Server

```php
<?php

use StringPhp\Router\HttpServer;

$server = new HttpServer()
```

After creating the HTTP server create a folder for your routes and add implementations of the `StringPhp\Router\RegisterRoutes` .

## Register Routes Implementation

```php
<?php

use Amp\Http\Server\Response;
use StringPhp\Router\RegisterRoutes;
use StringPhp\Router\Route;
use StringPhp\Router\Router;

class Routes implements RegisterRoutes {
    public static function home(Route $route): Response {
        return new Response('Hello World!');
    }

    public static function registerRoutes(Router $router): void {
        $route->get('/', [Routes::class, 'home']);         
    }
}
```

## Using Route Attributes

Implementing `RegisterRoutes` can get messy and hard to maintain very quickly. Which is why you can use route attributes to define routes as well with the `RegisterRoutesAttributes` abstract class.

```php
<?php

use StringPhp\Router\Attributes\Get;
use StringPhp\Router\Attributes\RegisterRouteAttributes;
use StringPhp\Router\Route;

class Routes extends RegisterRouteAttributes {
    #[Get('/')]
    public static function home(Route $route): Response {
        return new Response('Hello World!');
    }
}
```

## Using Endpoint with Route Attributes

If you would rather the entire class be used for the endpoint you can use the `Endpoint` abstract class attaching the route attributes to the class.

```php
use Amp\Http\Server\Response;
use StringPhp\Router\Attributes\Get;
use StringPhp\Router\Endpoint;
use StringPhp\Router\Route;

#[Get('/')]
class HelloWorld extends Endpoint {
    public static function handle(Route $route) : Response{
        return new Response('Hello World!');
    }
}
```

**Important Note:** Both `RegisterRouteAttributes` and `Endpoint` implement `RegisterRoutes` allowing you to also slightly tweak the registration process if needed. May separate methods in the future for easier modification.
